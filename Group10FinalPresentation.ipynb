    "One of the coolest things about coming from the suburbs into the city is the \"different style\". Cities tend to have a lot more character than normal towns and because of that have more charm. This is due to a number of things such as the people, stores/ restaurants, architecture, food, etc. Of these reasons, a very underrated one that can turn a neighborhood from good to great is art. While many believe public art doesn't matter when it comes to defining a neighborhood, in actuality it is extremely important. Public art is what causes many people to visit neighborhoods they wouldn't otherwise visit, which is why, as a city rich of art, I chose to rank the neighborhoods of Pittsburgh based on the amount of art they have."
